## More darkness!
The following project applies `bootstrap-dark` to the bootstrap documentation site allowing deeper testing of the theme:

- [Bootstrap 4.1 Dark theme docs](https://github.com/Carl-Hugo/bootstrap-dark-docs.git)

## Special thanks
I started this project based on the [Bootstrap Theme Kit](https://hackerthemes.com/kit/) by [Alexander Rechsteiner](https://github.com/arechsteiner) at [Hacker Themes](https://hackerthemes.com). This allows me to publish a lighter version of the theme; making it easier to be used (compared to the full Bootstrap Jekyll docs).
